1. first time 

	sid=1 ---> when it becames to be leader, what MQ will do?
		1. create several queues, for example, create queue:opoch+sid
	
	sid=2 when connecting to leader, start listen to MQ queue and recv data
	sid=3 when connecting to leader, start listen to MQ queue and recv data

2. second time when leader failed
	if sid = 1 failed, and after leader election, it recovery

	we assume sid = 3 win the leader, then it wait to the other learners to sync with it

	let's see what sid = 2 do
		Probabely, the queue for sid = 2 may not be totally completed, so after electon,and before start subscribe to the next opoch+sid queue it should recv all data from MQ and delete queues,  so it means it should do 2 things: 1, recv all data  2. delete old queue
		so here, we define 2 delete old queue, recv data

	let's see what sid = 1 do when it recovery
		1. may be old leader has some data to send, we should clear all these data
		2. may be old leader may send one msg to MQ, but it failed before it recv ack. So, the mq should ignore this msg, but mq won't. So may be client to send it again
		we should gurarety that client repeat msg won't make system down
		
		
		
set ha-policy
	1. if set ha-policy true, then nodes should be set nodename@hostname like hare@app-20 as same as the one declared in mq cluster
		
	2.
